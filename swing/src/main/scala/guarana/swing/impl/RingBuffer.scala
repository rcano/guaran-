/** A very simple, naive and not thread safe ring buffer.
  * <p/>
  * Design Principles
  *<ul>
  * <li>O(1) cost in regime operation;</li>
  * <li>Never allocates objects in regime operation;</li>
  * <li>Never provokes garbage collections, not even indirectly, in regime operation;</li>
  * <li>Not thread-safe, lock-free implementation: leave this concern to the caller;</li>
  * <li>Fail-fast when internal buffer is full or empty: leave this concern to the caller.</li>
  *</ul>
  * In order to achieve this, there's a small price to pay in regards to clarity: it's necessary
  * to define a sentinel value which means that the ring buffer was empty and nothing was taken
  * from it; or the ring buffer was full and it was not possible to put the passed value into
  * the ring buffer.
  *<p/>
  * Suppose, for example, that you are going to store positive integers into the ring buffer; any
  * negative value would be a good sentinel. Or suppose you are going to store case classes into
  * the ring buffer; in this case, pass a ``case object`` with special meaning in your application.
